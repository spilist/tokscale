[2025-12-02 02:21] - Task 1.1: Create benchmarks/ directory structure

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- None - clean project structure

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Created `benchmarks/results/` with `.gitkeep` to preserve directory in git
- Added `benchmarks/results/*` and `benchmarks/synthetic-data/` to `.gitignore`
- Results will be JSON files, synthetic data will be generated on-demand

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None identified

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Directory structure verified: `benchmarks/results/.gitkeep` exists
- .gitignore updated successfully

### LEARNINGS
- Project uses yarn (yarn.lock present)
- Build command: `tsx src/cli.ts` (direct execution, no compile step)
- Current structure is simple - no existing test framework

소요 시간: ~2 minutes

[2025-12-02 02:23] - Task 1.2: Implement benchmarks/generate.ts

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- None

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Created comprehensive synthetic data generator with 4 source types
- Default scale generates ~5,900 messages total:
  - OpenCode: 500 messages (50 sessions × 10 messages)
  - Claude: 2,500 assistant entries (10 projects × 5 files × 100 entries, 50% assistant)
  - Codex: 2,400 token events (30 sessions × 80 events)
  - Gemini: 500 messages (5 projects × 4 sessions × 50 messages, 50% gemini)
- Added --scale flag for CI to run larger benchmarks
- Added --output flag for custom output directory
- Date range: 6 months (2025-06-01 to 2025-12-01)

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- Synthetic data mimics real format but runner needs to support custom data paths

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Ran: `npx tsx benchmarks/generate.ts`
- Output: 601 files generated in benchmarks/synthetic-data/
- Verified file formats match real data structures for all 4 sources

### LEARNINGS
- OpenCode stores individual JSON files per message
- Claude/Codex use JSONL format (one JSON per line)
- Gemini stores entire sessions as single JSON files
- Codex has stateful parsing (turn_context sets model, token_count tracks deltas)

소요 시간: ~5 minutes

[2025-12-02 02:25] - Task 1.3: Implement benchmarks/runner.ts

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- First iteration is always slow (~1100ms) due to module loading
- Need warmup iterations for accurate benchmarks

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Measures wall-clock time using performance.now()
- Measures peak memory using process.memoryUsage().rss
- Supports --synthetic flag for CI (overrides HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, CODEX_HOME)
- Supports --iterations and --warmup flags for statistical accuracy
- Calculates min, max, median, mean, stdDev for all metrics
- Saves JSON results to benchmarks/results/

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- Need to add npm scripts for convenience

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Ran: `npx tsx benchmarks/runner.ts --synthetic --iterations 3 --warmup 1`
- TypeScript baseline (synthetic data, 5900 messages):
  - Wall-clock: ~79ms median (7.4ms stddev)
  - Peak memory: ~371MB
  - This is our baseline for comparison with Rust

### LEARNINGS
- Warmup is crucial: first iteration includes module loading (~1000ms overhead)
- With warmup, TypeScript processes 5900 messages in ~80ms
- That's ~74,000 messages/second throughput
- Memory usage is high (371MB) - opportunity for Rust optimization

소요 시간: ~5 minutes

---

[2025-12-02 02:26] - Task 1.4: Add npm scripts for benchmarking

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- None

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Added 5 npm scripts to package.json:
  - `bench:generate`: Generate synthetic benchmark data
  - `bench:ts`: Run TypeScript benchmark with real data
  - `bench:ts:synthetic`: Run TypeScript benchmark with synthetic data (5 iterations, 1 warmup)
  - `bench:rust`: Run Rust benchmark with real data (future)
  - `bench:rust:synthetic`: Run Rust benchmark with synthetic data (future)

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Ran: `yarn bench:ts:synthetic`
- Output: Benchmark completed successfully, results saved to benchmarks/results/
- Ran: `yarn bench:generate --help`
- Output: Help message displayed correctly

### LEARNINGS
- yarn script arguments pass through correctly
- 5 iterations with 1 warmup is a good default for CI

소요 시간: ~2 minutes

---

[2025-12-02 02:27] - Task 1.5: Run baseline benchmark with real data

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- None

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Ran benchmark with user's actual session data
- 3 iterations with 1 warmup for consistency

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Ran: `yarn bench:ts` (real data benchmark)
- TypeScript baseline (REAL data, 18,671 messages):
  - Wall-clock: **1805.63ms median** (75.71ms stddev)
  - Peak memory: **575MB**
  - Sources: Claude, Gemini, OpenCode (19 days of data)
  - Throughput: ~10,340 messages/second

### LEARNINGS
- Real data performance comparison:
  - Synthetic: 5,900 messages in 79ms = 74,683 msg/sec
  - Real: 18,671 messages in 1,806ms = 10,340 msg/sec
- Real data is 7x slower per message than synthetic!
- This suggests:
  1. Real files are larger (more content per message)
  2. File I/O is the bottleneck (more files to read)
  3. Significant room for Rust optimization
- Target for Rust implementation: sub-200ms for real data (~8-9x speedup)

소요 시간: ~2 minutes

---

[2025-12-02 02:29] - Task 1.6: Document in benchmarks/README.md

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- None

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Created comprehensive README with:
  - Quick start commands
  - Tool documentation (generate.ts, runner.ts)
  - Baseline results tables
  - Target performance goals
  - CI integration example
  - Result file format explanation

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None - Phase 1 complete!

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- README.md created at benchmarks/README.md
- Documents all benchmark scripts and usage

### LEARNINGS
- Phase 1 complete - benchmark infrastructure ready
- Baseline established:
  - TypeScript: 1,806ms for 18,671 real messages
  - Target: ~200ms with Rust (9x speedup)

소요 시간: ~2 minutes

---

## PHASE 1 COMPLETE

**Summary:**
- Created benchmark infrastructure with synthetic data generator and runner
- Established TypeScript baselines:
  - Synthetic (5,900 msgs): 79ms median
  - Real (18,671 msgs): 1,806ms median
- Target for Rust: ~8-9x speedup
- Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Rust Project Setup

---

[2025-12-02 08:06] - Phase 2: Rust Project Setup (Tasks 2.1-2.7)

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- napi-rs CLI `new` command requires interactive input, manual setup was easier
- napi config format changed: `name` → `binaryName`, `triples` → `targets`
- Default `triples.defaults` causes duplicate target errors

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Created manual project structure for better control:
  ```
  core/
  ├── Cargo.toml      (napi 2.x, rayon, simd-json, walkdir, chrono)
  ├── build.rs        (napi-build setup)
  ├── package.json    (npm package config with targets)
  ├── index.js        (platform-aware native binding loader)
  ├── index.d.ts      (TypeScript type definitions)
  └── src/
      ├── lib.rs          (NAPI exports, types)
      ├── scanner.rs      (parallel file discovery)
      ├── parser.rs       (SIMD JSON parsing)
      ├── aggregator.rs   (parallel map-reduce)
      └── sessions/
          ├── mod.rs          (UnifiedMessage type)
          ├── opencode.rs     (OpenCode parser)
          ├── claudecode.rs   (Claude parser)
          ├── codex.rs        (Codex parser - stateful)
          └── gemini.rs       (Gemini parser)
  ```

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- Many warnings about unused code (expected - not wired together yet)
- Need to add workspace config to root package.json

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- `cargo check`: All code compiles ✅
- `yarn build:debug`: Native module built (904KB .node file) ✅
- Node.js test:
  ```
  Version: 0.1.0
  Health: token-tracker-core is healthy!
  ```

### LEARNINGS
- napi-rs 2.x works well with Rust 1.92 nightly
- simd-json requires mutable byte slice (`&mut [u8]`)
- NAPI object struct fields use snake_case in Rust, camelCase in JS
- Build time: ~15 seconds for debug, expect longer for release with LTO
- Native module size: 904KB (debug), expect smaller with release + strip

소요 시간: ~15 minutes

[2025-12-03] - Primer Design System Integration

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- `styled-components@5` requires SSR registry for Next.js App Router
- Primer's `ProgressBar.Item` doesn't support `sx` prop (use inline styles)
- Need `react-is` package for styled-components compatibility

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Selective Primer adoption (not full migration) to preserve existing design
- Created provider stack: `StyledComponentsRegistry` → `PrimerProvider`
- Components migrated:
  - **SegmentedControl**: Period filter on leaderboard
  - **Pagination**: Page navigation
  - **Avatar**: User avatars throughout
  - **ActionMenu + ActionList**: User dropdown menu
  - **Label**: Badges for rank, sources, models
- Kept custom components: Contribution graph, stat cards, token breakdown bar

### FILES CREATED
- `frontend/src/lib/providers/StyledComponentsRegistry.tsx` - SSR support
- `frontend/src/lib/providers/PrimerProvider.tsx` - Theme integration
- `frontend/src/lib/providers/Providers.tsx` - Combined provider
- `frontend/src/lib/providers/index.ts` - Exports

### PACKAGES ADDED
```json
{
  "@primer/react": "^38.3.0",
  "@primer/primitives": "^11.3.1",
  "styled-components": "^5.3.11",
  "react-is": "^19.2.0",
  "@types/styled-components": "^5.1.36"
}
```

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- TypeScript: ✅ No errors
- Build: ✅ All 18 pages generated successfully
- ESLint: Minor warnings (pre-existing, not from Primer)

### LEARNINGS
- Primer's `colorMode` values: `'day' | 'night' | 'auto'`
- Use `preventSSRMismatch` on ThemeProvider for hydration
- `ActionMenu` is self-contained (manages its own open state)
- Primer CSS imports: `@primer/primitives/dist/css/functional/themes/*.css`
- Data visualization colors: `--data-{color}-color-emphasis` CSS variables

소요 시간: ~20 minutes

[2025-12-04 02:36] - Task 1: Push database schema to PostgreSQL

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- drizzle-kit doesn't automatically load .env.local files
- Need to source environment variables before running drizzle-kit push

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Used `source .env.local` to load environment variables before running drizzle-kit
- Database schema was already synced (previous work), so "No changes detected"

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Ran: `set -a && source .env.local && set +a && npx drizzle-kit push`
- Output: "[✓] Pulling schema from database... [i] No changes detected"
- All 6 tables already exist: users, sessions, api_tokens, device_codes, submissions, daily_breakdown

### LEARNINGS
- Correct command: `set -a && source .env.local && set +a && npx drizzle-kit push`
- drizzle-kit reads environment variables from process.env, not from .env files automatically
- Alternative: install `dotenv-cli` and use `npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npx drizzle-kit push`

소요 시간: ~2 minutes

[2025-12-04 02:45] - Task 7: Update credentials path with migration and cleanup

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- None - clean implementation

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Updated both `src/credentials.ts` and `src/cursor.ts` to use XDG-compliant path:
  - Old: `~/.token-tracker/`
  - New: `~/.config/token-tracker/`
- Added automatic migration from old path to new path
- Migration logic:
  1. Check if new file doesn't exist AND old file exists
  2. Copy old file to new location with secure permissions (0o600)
  3. Delete old file
  4. Try to remove old directory (silently fails if not empty)
- Both files attempt to remove `OLD_CONFIG_DIR` - intentional redundancy for cleanup
- Migration called on `loadCredentials()` and `loadCursorCredentials()` (read operations)
- Cache migration called on `syncCursorCache()` (when cache is actually used)

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None - Task 8 (Final verification) is next

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Ran: `yarn dev --help` - CLI runs without errors
- Ran: `yarn dev whoami` - Shows "Not logged in" (expected - fresh migration)
- Commit: `refactor(cli): migrate credentials to XDG path (~/.config/token-tracker)` (7d5b810)

### LEARNINGS
- XDG Base Directory Spec: config should be in `~/.config/<app>/` on Unix systems
- Node.js `fs.cpSync()` and `fs.rmSync()` available for recursive directory operations
- Using try-catch to silently handle migration failures is good practice - CLI shouldn't crash
- `fs.rmdirSync()` only works on empty directories - perfect for cleanup

소요 시간: ~5 minutes

---

[2025-12-04 02:52] - Task 8: Run full build and lint verification (FINAL TASK)

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- None - all checks passed

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Ran all verification commands in sequence
- Verified all 6 commits are in place with correct messages

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None - ALL TASKS COMPLETED

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- `yarn lint`: ✅ Passed with exit code 0 (no errors, no warnings)
- `yarn build`: ✅ "Compiled successfully in 2.1s", 18 pages generated
- `yarn dev --help`: ✅ Shows help message
- `yarn dev whoami`: ✅ Shows "Not logged in" (expected)
- Cursor source: ✅ 3 matches in types.ts and submission.ts

### LEARNINGS
- Next.js 16 with Turbopack builds very fast (~8 seconds total)
- API routes are correctly marked as dynamic (ƒ)
- Static pages are correctly prerendered (○)

소요 시간: ~3 minutes

[2025-12-12 20:37] - TUI Redesign + Critical Bug Fixes + Performance Optimization

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- lib.rs used "/" fallback when HOME not set - could scan entire filesystem
- cursor.ts used Date.now() fallback for invalid timestamps - misleading data
- pricing.rs used simple contains() for fuzzy matching - too permissive

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- **TUI Redesign**: Added Overview tab with bar chart and model breakdown
  - New components: BarChart, Legend, ModelListItem, OverviewView
  - Provider color mapping (anthropic/openai/google/cursor)
  - Fixed DST bug in streak calculation using Date.UTC()
- **lib.rs**: Created `get_home_dir()` helper that returns `napi::Result<String>`
  - Proper error propagation instead of silent fallback
- **pricing.rs**: Added `is_word_boundary_match()` for stricter fuzzy matching
  - Only matches at word boundaries (start of string, after hyphen/underscore)
- **cursor.ts**: Changed timestamp fallback from `Date.now()` to `0` (epoch)
  - Added length guard for `dateStr.slice(0, 10)`

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None - all critical bugs fixed

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Ran: `cargo test` - 44 tests passed
- Ran: `yarn test` (core) - 11 tests passed  
- Ran: `yarn cli models --benchmark` - CLI working, ~3.9s total

### LEARNINGS
- napi-rs `napi::Result<T>` in Rust becomes throwing function in JS
- Word boundary matching: check if character before/after match is non-alphanumeric
- Two-phase parallel processing already implemented (Cursor sync + pricing + local parsing)

소요 시간: ~15 minutes

[2025-12-12 22:57] - Task 1: Verify Zig is installed (OpenTUI Migration)

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- Zig was not installed on the system (required for OpenTUI native build)

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Installed Zig via Homebrew: `brew install zig`
- Installed version: 0.15.2
- Dependencies installed: llvm@20 (1.5GB), lld@20 (5.6MB)

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- None - Zig is ready for OpenTUI compilation

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- Ran: `zig version` → 0.15.2
- Installation successful via Homebrew

### LEARNINGS
- Zig 0.15.2 is current stable version
- Requires LLVM as dependency (~1.5GB)
- OpenTUI uses Zig for native terminal rendering

Time taken: ~2 minutes

---

[2025-12-12 23:25] - OpenTUI Migration Complete

### DISCOVERED ISSUES
- OpenTUI requires Bun runtime (not compatible with Node.js/tsx)
- Node.js ESM loader fails on .scm tree-sitter files
- Top-level await in OpenTUI modules breaks tsx
- OpenTUI text nodes cannot have nested JSX elements
- TypeScript module resolution differs from Bun's runtime resolution

### IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
- Switched dev script from `tsx` to `bun` for TUI mode
- Created custom type declarations (`opentui.d.ts`) for OpenTUI modules
- Used template literals for all text content (OpenTUI requirement)
- Converted all Ink patterns: `color` → `fg`, `dimColor` → `dim`, PascalCase → lowercase
- Added theming feature with 9 color palettes directly in migration

### PROBLEMS FOR NEXT TASKS
- TypeScript LSP shows module resolution errors (runtime works fine with Bun)
- May need to update CI/CD to use Bun for TUI tests
- Need manual testing to verify TUI rendering quality

### VERIFICATION RESULTS
- CLI commands work: `bun src/cli.ts --help`, `bun src/cli.ts models`
- TUI launches but needs interactive testing for full verification
- Ink dependency removed from package.json

### LEARNINGS
- OpenTUI is designed for Bun, not Node.js
- Text nodes must be pure strings (use template literals)
- `useKeyboard` receives `key.name` not `input` string
- `useTerminalDimensions` returns `{width, height}` object
- `process.exit(0)` instead of `useApp().exit()`
- Components are lowercase intrinsic elements: `<box>`, `<text>`

Time taken: ~25 minutes
